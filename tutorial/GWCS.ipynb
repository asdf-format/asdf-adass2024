    "==========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This section highlights one of the most powerful capabilities of ASDF; namely\n",
    "its ability to save arbitrarily complex coordinate transformations with great \n",
    "flexibility. This includes the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- combine transformations using arithmetic operators\n",
    "- combine transformations in series\n",
    "- for an arbitrary number of dimensions\n",
    "- define intermediate coordinates (e.g., the slit plane of a spectrograph)\n",
    "- parameterize transformations using the parameters as extra dimensions\n",
    "  (e.g., spectral order, position across a slit, date, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with the FITS WCS system, which works well in imaging and spectra\n",
    "for standard projections and dispersions, but poorly when dealing with raw data\n",
    "cointaining complex distortions, or discontinuous transforms (e.g., IFUs), and \n",
    "particularly for slitless spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For HST, to achieve sub 0.01 pixel accuracy, 3 different distortion components \n",
    "had to be modeled, which were impossible to represent within the FITS WCS \n",
    "framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not able to convey the full capabilities in a few minutes of a tutorial.\n",
    "This tutorial will illustrate some basics with an imaging example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple projection and then augment with a distortion model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple projection replicates the basic FITS capabilities using a tangent\n",
    "projection followed by the appropriate transformation to celestial coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves identifying the point in the detector array that will be the tangent\n",
    "point, applying the appropriate offset and scaling before applying the tangent\n",
    "projection, and then transforming the resulting angular coordinates to celestial\n",
    "coordinates. Schematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offset detector coordinates to make tangent point in detector have 0, 0 coordinates\n",
    "- Scale resulting array coordinates to corresponding angular scale.\n",
    "- Rotate detector coordinates so that north is up\n",
    "- Apply inverse tangent projection.\n",
    "- Transform resulting spherical coordinates to corresponding reference point\n",
    "  in the celestial coordinate system with the appropriate position angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are performed using astropy modeling package models."
